	 * Interface that all the classes with Nape physics need to implement. 
	 * Classes that implement this interface should also extend Node2D 
	 * e.g. [NapeSprite2D:INapeNode] > [Sprite2D] > [Node2D]
	 * 
	 * This allows NapeScene and it's descendants to target the Nape (phyiscs) bodies as required.
